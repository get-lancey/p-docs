## Overview

Connect Lancey with Intercom to automatically convert customer support conversations, feature requests, and bug reports into pull requests. Keep your support team informed when issues are resolved.

<Tip>
  Intercom integration enables Lancey to scan customer conversations and automatically generate fixes, turning support requests into deployed solutions.
</Tip>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration settings">
    Head to the [Integrations](https://platform.lancey.ai/settings/integrations) page in your dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Intercom connector">
    Click on the **Intercom** connector
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorization">
    You'll be redirected to Intercom to authorize Lancey. Review the permissions and click **Authorize** to proceed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select workspace">
    Choose your Intercom workspace to connect with Lancey
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure conversation rules" stepNumber={5}>
    Set up rules for which conversations Lancey should monitor:
    - Conversations tagged with specific labels
    - Conversations assigned to certain teams
    - Conversations with specific keywords
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

Once Intercom is connected, Lancey will:

- **Monitor conversations** - Watch Intercom conversations for support requests and bug reports
- **Identify action items** - Extract actionable technical issues from customer conversations
- **Create PRs automatically** - Generate pull requests to address identified issues
- **Post updates** - Reply in the original Intercom conversation when a PR is created or merged
- **Track resolutions** - Keep customers informed about when their issues are deployed
