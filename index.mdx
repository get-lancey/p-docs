## What is Lancey?

Lancey lets you spin up multiplayer agents for your engineering team so you can plan and execute code tasks as a team, in the background.

Typically, most engineers rely on IDE-based copilots that can only handle one task at a time with no team visibility. This leaves you waiting for an LLM to complete a single task while unable to work on anything else.

Lancey lets you **100x your engineering output** by parallelizing tasks across hundreds of AI agents working in the background.
