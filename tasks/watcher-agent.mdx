## Overview

The Watcher agent is a Lancey feature that assigns an AI agent to monitor your tasks and provide intelligent nudges to keep them progressing, just like a human would. This allows you to work on more things simultaneously while your agent ensures tasks move forward efficiently.

<Tip>
  Watcher agent is assigned to every task by default, giving your team more bandwidth to focus on high-level decisions while agents handle the execution details.
</Tip>

## How it works

Once a Watcher agent is assigned to a task, it continuously:

- **Monitors progress** - Tracks task execution and identifies blockers
- **Detects issues** - Identifies when a task gets stuck or encounters problems
- **Provides nudges** - Suggests next steps or adjustments to keep momentum
- **Maintains context** - Keeps track of task history and requirements
- **Adapts dynamically** - Adjusts approach based on task progress and results

This creates a more human-like workflow where an agent actively helps move work forward rather than just executing a single planned path.

## Managing Watcher agent

### Viewing assignment status

When you open a task, the **Properties panel** on the right side of the screen shows whether a Watcher agent is currently assigned to the task.

### Unassigning Watcher agent

If you want to disable the Watcher agent for a specific task:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the task">
    Navigate to a task you want to modify
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Properties panel">
    Look at the right-hand side of the screen for the Properties panel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Unassign">
    Click the **Unassign** button next to the Watcher agent
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the action when prompted
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Reassigning Watcher agent

To re-enable Watcher agent on a task that has been unassigned:

1. Open the task
2. Look in the Properties panel for an **Assign Watcher agent** option
3. Click to reassign a new agent to monitor the task

## When to use Watcher agent

Use Watcher agent in these scenarios:

- **Complex tasks** - Keep complex, multi-step tasks on track automatically
- **Low-priority work** - Let agents handle routine tasks while you focus on important decisions
- **High volume** - Manage more tasks simultaneously with agent assistance
- **Uncertain requirements** - Agent can adapt when requirements shift during execution

## When to unassign Watcher agent

Consider unassigning Watcher agent when:

- You need full manual control over task execution
- The task is simple and doesn't need monitoring
- You're running experiments that require precise, non-adaptive behavior
- You want to review and approve each step before the agent proceeds
- You're working with sensitive or high-risk changes

## Best practices

<Accordion title="Keep agents assigned for routine work">
  Let Watcher agents handle standard fixes and improvements. This frees your team to focus on strategic decisions and complex problems.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Monitor high-risk tasks manually">
  For critical or sensitive tasks, consider unassigning the Watcher agent to maintain tighter control and require explicit approvals at each step.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use in combination with Auto Processing">
  Pair Watcher agent with Auto Processing for a fully autonomous workflow that monitors and executes tasks with minimal human intervention.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Review agent decisions">
  Check the task history to see how Watcher agent guided the task. Use this insight to refine your auto-processing rules and task instructions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create team policies">
  Establish team guidelines about when Watcher agents should be assigned or unassigned based on task type, complexity, and risk level.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Watcher agent isn't responding to blockers?">
  Verify that:
  - The Watcher agent is still assigned in the Properties panel
  - Your task instructions are clear and specific
  - The agent has sufficient context about the issue
  - Your AI model configuration is set up correctly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Task seems stuck with Watcher agent assigned?">
  Try:
  - Checking the task history to see what the agent attempted
  - Reviewing error messages or logs for specific blockers
  - Providing additional context or clarification to the task
  - Manually unassigning and reassigning a fresh agent
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I assign a different Watcher agent?">
  When you unassign a Watcher agent, a new agent will be automatically assigned on next task update. All Watcher agents have the same capabilities, so you're not selecting between different types.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know if Watcher agent made changes?">
  Review the task history and activity log to see:
  - Actions the agent suggested
  - Changes it made or attempted
  - Course corrections it provided
  - Any errors it encountered
</Accordion>
