## Managing team members

### Viewing team members

Your Members page displays all current team members with:

- Name and email
- Role (Admin or Member)
- Join date
- Status (Active or Pending)

### Changing a member's role

1. Find the team member in the Members list
2. Click the role dropdown next to their name
3. Select the new role
4. Click **Update**

### Removing a team member

1. Click the menu icon next to the team member
2. Select **Remove from workspace**
3. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
  Removing a team member will revoke their access immediately. Consider exporting any important work first.
</Warning>

## Pending invitations

Members with "Pending" status haven't accepted their invitation yet:

- **Resend invitation** - Click the menu and select "Resend" to send the invite email again
- **Cancel invitation** - Click the menu and select "Cancel" to revoke the pending invite
- **Auto-expire** - Invitations expire after 30 days

## Best practices

<Accordion title="Assign appropriate roles">
  Give team members the minimum permissions they need. Start with Member role and escalate to Admin only when necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Regularly review team access">
  Monthly, review your Members list to ensure everyone still needs their access level and remove inactive users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use separate Admin accounts">
  Have multiple admins for your workspace in case one is unavailable. At least one other admin should be able to manage billing and settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Monitor pending invitations">
  Follow up with team members if their invitations are still pending after a few days.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Team member didn't receive invitation?">
  - Check that the email address is correct
  - Ask them to check spam/junk folders
  - Resend the invitation from the Members page
  - Verify their email domain isn't blocking Lancey
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Member can't access the workspace?">
  Verify that:
  - They clicked the invite link in the email
  - They created their account successfully
  - Their status shows "Active" (not "Pending")
  - They're using the correct email address
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I transfer Admin to another user?">
  You can change a Member's role to Admin by:
  1. Going to **Settings → Members**
  2. Clicking the role dropdown next to their name
  3. Selecting "Admin"
  4. Clicking "Update"
</Accordion>
