description: "Configure Model Context Protocol servers to extend Lancey's capabilities."

## Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers allow you to connect external tools, data sources, and services to Lancey. This enables agents to access additional context and capabilities beyond the core platform.

<Tip>
  MCP servers expand what Lancey agents can do. Connect relevant tools to give agents the information and access they need to work effectively.
</Tip>

## What are MCP servers?

MCP servers act as bridges between Lancey and external systems:

- **Data access** - Connect to databases, APIs, or knowledge bases
- **Tool integration** - Integrate with external tools and services
- **Context enrichment** - Provide agents with additional context and information
- **Custom capabilities** - Extend Lancey with domain-specific functionality

## Connecting an MCP server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to MCP Servers">
    Go to **Settings → MCP Servers** in your dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Server">
    Click the **Add** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter server details">
    Provide:
    - Server URL or connection endpoint
    - Authentication credentials (if required)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the server">
    Click **Add Server** to add the server to your workspace
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing MCP servers

### Viewing connected servers

Your MCP Servers page displays:

- Status (Connected, Disconnected, Error)
- Connection type
- Actions menu

### Updating server configuration

1. Click the server you want to update
2. Modify the connection details or credentials
3. Click **Save** to apply changes

### Removing a server

1. Click the menu icon next to the server
2. Select **Remove**
3. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
  Removing a server will stop agents from accessing the resources it provides. Tasks in progress may fail if they depend on this server.
</Warning>

## Server types

Common MCP server configurations:

- **Database connections** - Connect to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other databases
- **API servers** - Integrate with REST or GraphQL APIs
- **Document stores** - Connect to knowledge bases or documentation systems
- **Custom tools** - Deploy your own MCP-compatible tools
- **Third-party services** - Integrate with SaaS platforms

## Best practices

<Accordion title="Start with essential servers">
  Begin with MCP servers that provide critical context. Add more as needed rather than connecting everything at once.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Monitor server health">
  Check connection status regularly and set up alerts for disconnections or errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Document your servers">
  Keep clear notes about what each MCP server provides and why it's needed for your team.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rotate credentials regularly">
  Update API keys and passwords periodically for security. Remove access for servers no longer in use.
</Accordion>


## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Server connection issues?">
  - Verify the server URL is correct
  - Check that credentials are valid
  - Ensure the server is running and accessible
  - Check firewall/network rules if external
  - Review server logs for error details
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agents can't access the MCP server?">
  Verify that:
  - The server status shows "Connected"
  - Agents have been running after the server was added
  - The server isn't rate-limiting requests
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Server connection keeps dropping?">
  - Check server stability and uptime
  - Verify network connectivity is stable
  - Update credentials if they recently changed
  - Contact the server administrator for support
  - Consider using a more reliable server endpoint
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I create a custom MCP server?">
  You can build custom MCP servers following the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Contact our team for guidance on implementing your specific use case.
